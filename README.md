# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analyzer
Social Media Sentiment Analyzer is a Python project that fetches tweets based on a keyword and analyzes their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). It leverages the Twitter API for data collection and uses TextBlob for natural language processing. The results are visualized using bar charts to show sentiment distribution.
